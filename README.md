# NPLCommunityQuestionAnswering

This is a NLP project assignment that is being given from the http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/ conference

## Getting Started - Description

Community Question Answering

A. Question-Comment Similarity: given a question from a question-comment thread, rank the comments according to their relevance (similarity) with respect to the question (this corresponds to the last year's task: SemEval-2015 Task 3).

B. Question-Question Similarity: given the neâ€‹w question, rerank all similar questions retrieved by a search engine (assuming that the answers to the similar questions should be answering the new question as well).
