REC-1 - percentage of questions with at least 1 correct answer in the top @X positions (useful for tasks were questions have at most one correct answer)
ACC   - accuracy, i.e. number of correct answers retrieved at rank @X normalized by the rank and the total number of questions
AC1   - the number of correct answers at @X normalized by the number of maximum possible answers (perfect re-ranker)
AC2   - the absolute number of correct answers at @X
