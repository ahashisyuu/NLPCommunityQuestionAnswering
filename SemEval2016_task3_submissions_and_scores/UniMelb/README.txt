  - 5.1 Core approach
  The final label for each question-answer pair was determined by averaging the scores of three different systems. One was a NaiveBayes classifier trained on several lexical similarity measure scores as features. One was an SVM classifier trained on a different set of lexical similarity scores as features, and one was a convolutional neural network using word embeddings.

  - 5.2 Supervised or unsupervised: supervised

  - 5.3 Important/interesting/novel features used: 7 different lexical similarity measures. 

  - 5.4 Important/interesting/novel tools used: Weka

  - 5.5 Significant data pre/post-processing: case folding

  - 5.6 Other data used (outside of the provided): --

  - 5.7 Did you participate in SemEval-2015 task 3? No.
